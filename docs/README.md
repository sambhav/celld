# celld documentation

celld is a stateful distributed system. It runs server-side JavaScript on
your machines, and it stores the long-term state in a bucket that you own:
S3-compatible, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. The JavaScript
API follows the API of Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects.

In Cloudflare terms, a cell is a Durable Object: a small server with a
name and a private SQLite database. You make one cell for each user, each
document, each chat room, or each AI agent. A cell serves HTTP, holds
WebSocket connections, sets alarms, and makes outbound connections. Cells
share no database, so the application divides into cells from the start.
Each cell runs on one thread: a second request interleaves only while the
first awaits, and storage operations are synchronous and never interleave,
so the data in a cell stays consistent.

You run celld as one process on each machine. That process is a **node**,
and the nodes that share one bucket are a **fleet**. Any node can serve
any cell, so you add capacity by starting another node against the same
bucket.

A cell has the same states as a Durable Object. A **resident** cell is in
memory: it is **active** while it does work, and **idle** when it waits.
celld removes an idle cell from memory. A cell that then keeps its
hibernatable WebSocket clients, and stays on its node, is **hibernated**.
A cell that no node holds is **inactive**. An inactive cell is only an
object in the bucket, so it costs almost zero, and every cell starts in
this state.

A cell keeps no memory across these transitions, so the constructor
runs again on the next event. A hibernated cell wakes the same way a
cold start does, except that its WebSocket clients stay connected and
it stays on its node.

One 8 GB node holds 1,000 resident cells, so one resident cell costs
approximately $0.05 each month.

Exactly one node serves a cell at a time. The nodes do not elect a leader
or keep a membership list: a node claims a cell by writing a small record
to the bucket, and it writes that record with a condition the storage
enforces — the write succeeds only if nobody else changed the record
first. Object storage therefore decides who wins, and two nodes cannot
both claim the same cell. The claim expires unless the node keeps
renewing it, so a machine that dies releases its cells without anyone
having to declare it dead.

celld does not answer a write until the data survives a failure, so no
write you were told succeeded is ever lost. That guarantee is called
RPO=0, for a recovery point of zero.

How celld earns it depends on how many nodes you run. One node writes the
data to the bucket first, which costs one storage round trip. Two or more
nodes are faster: the node serving the cell sends each write to another
node as well, and answers as soon as that node has the data on its own
disk. celld uploads the data to the bucket afterwards, so the bucket
still holds the long-term state. Run two or more nodes if write latency
matters to you; a single node has nobody to send to, so every write waits
for the bucket. `CELLD_DURABILITY` selects this behavior and defaults to
`fleet`.

When a node stops, another node takes the cell over. It first collects
whatever the stopped node had not uploaded yet, so the takeover starts
from a complete history. The [guarantees](guarantees.md) page
gives the full mechanism and the exact properties that the bucket must
provide.

When an event sets an alarm before its response boundary, celld does not send a
successful response until a durable wake entry covers the alarm. celld does
not let a later `waitUntil` alarm delay another event's response.

## What do you build with cells

A cell fits a workload that divides into named, stateful units:

- **Real-time applications.** A multiplayer game, a chat room, or a
  collaborative document is one cell. The cell holds the WebSocket
  connections and the state of one room, so the room needs no lock and
  no external message bus.
- **Agents.** Each AI agent is one cell. The cell holds the memory, the
  schedule, and the inbox of one agent in its own SQLite database. An
  inactive agent has no resident process, so a large agent fleet costs
  almost nothing between events.
- **Sharded web applications.** One cell for each user, each tenant, or
  each device shards the application from the start. The contention of
  one shared database does not appear, because no shared database
  exists.

## Install

The installer downloads the `celld` binary. Replication runs inside the
celld process, so a node needs no external replicator.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://celld.dev/install.sh | sh
```

If the installer tells you, add `~/.local/bin` to `PATH`. To install one
exact release, set `CELLD_VERSION` to its tag, for example `v0.0.1`; to
go back, run the installer again with the previous tag. The releases are
on [GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/celld/releases), and each release
has a GitHub Actions build attestation: verify a downloaded file with
`gh attestation verify <asset> --repo denoland/celld`.

## Configure object storage

For an S3-compatible bucket, celld uses the standard AWS credential
chain. On Amazon EKS, celld reads the Pod Identity credentials from the
injected environment variables and the authorization-token file. For
Cloudflare R2: create a bucket, create an S3 API token with access to
that bucket, and set these variables:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_REGION=auto
export S3_ENDPOINT=https://ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
export CELLD_BUCKET=s3://YOUR-BUCKET
```

For Google Cloud Storage, celld uses Application Default Credentials.
Create a bucket. Then authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default
login`, or point `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` at a service-account
key that has access to the bucket. Then set the bucket:

```sh
export CELLD_BUCKET=gs://YOUR-BUCKET
```

A `gs://` bucket takes no `S3_ENDPOINT` and no `AWS_*` credentials, and
celld ignores the storage region. On a Compute Engine instance, celld can
use the attached service account, but the access scopes of the instance
cap this credential, and the default scope permits only storage reads.
Create the instance with the `cloud-platform` scope, so the IAM role of
the service account controls the access.

For Azure Blob Storage, the bucket NAME is the container, and the
storage account comes from the environment. Create a container. Then
set the account and one credential:

```sh
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=YOUR-ACCOUNT
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=...
export CELLD_BUCKET=az://YOUR-CONTAINER
```

celld accepts three Azure credential families — a storage account key, a
managed identity, and a workload identity — and you must configure
exactly one. A system-assigned managed identity needs only the account
name. A user-assigned managed identity needs exactly one selector among
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_OBJECT_ID`, and `AZURE_MSI_RESOURCE_ID`,
because two selectors can name two different identities. An identity
must hold the Azure Blob data-plane permission to read, write, list, and
delete blobs; the built-in
[`Storage Blob Data Contributor`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor)
role supplies it.

celld reads a managed identity from the Azure instance metadata service,
which an Azure VM and an AKS node supply. Azure App Service and Azure
Container Apps supply a different endpoint, so a managed identity does
not work there; use a workload identity or an account key instead. The
standard AKS workload identity environment (`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`,
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`)
works with the public authority host, `https://login.microsoftonline.com`,
with or without a trailing slash; celld rejects a sovereign or custom
host. celld also rejects each recognized Azure configuration variable
outside these families — another credential source, an endpoint override,
the OneLake endpoint — and it ignores an `AZURE_*` name that
`object_store` 0.12 does not recognize, because that name cannot change
the client.

An `az://` bucket takes no `S3_ENDPOINT` and no `AWS_*` credentials, and
celld ignores the storage region. celld qualifies an `az://` bucket for
a production fleet: the conditional-write contract and the multipart
upload path were tested against a live Azure account on 2026-08-18 (see
[guarantees](guarantees.md)). For local development against
Azurite, set `AZURE_STORAGE_USE_EMULATOR=true`; Azurite is a development
store, so celld does not qualify it for a fleet either.

The bucket credentials give full control of the fleet, so keep them
safe. The bucket contains the deployments, the SQLite replicas, the
ownership records, the node leases, and the peer-authentication secret.

A bucket value can add a key prefix: `s3://YOUR-BUCKET/PREFIX`. Every
object of the fleet then goes below `PREFIX/`, so two fleets can share one
bucket. A bucket value without a prefix keeps the objects at the root of
the bucket, therefore an existing fleet does not move its data.

The store must provide conditional writes and read-after-write
consistency, because the ownership records depend on them. Amazon S3,
Cloudflare R2, Google Cloud Storage, Tigris, and Azure Blob Storage
qualify; Backblaze B2, Hetzner, and DigitalOcean Spaces do not. MinIO
(the community edition) passes the storage test, but celld has not
qualified it for production; do not use RELEASE.2025-09-06T17-38-46Z,
which rejects the conditional create that the first deploy sends
(denoland/celld#162). See [what celld guarantees](guarantees.md) for the
exact requirements.

## Deploy an application

If the project contains Worker code, install `esbuild` on `PATH`; an
asset-only project does not need it. Then run `celld deploy` from an
applicable Wrangler project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/denoland/celld
cd celld/examples/counter
celld deploy . \
  --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" \
  --endpoint "$S3_ENDPOINT" \
  --region "$AWS_REGION"
```

`celld deploy` accepts module Workers, Durable Object bindings, service
bindings, variables, cron triggers, D1 databases, KV namespaces, Workflows,
WebAssembly modules, and static assets. An asset project can include a
Worker or be asset-only, and the asset functions include the assets
binding, HTML handling, not-found handling, worker-first routes,
`_headers`, and `_redirects`. If the Wrangler configuration contains an
unknown key, the deploy stops with an error. See the
[Cloudflare compatibility](cloudflare-compat.md) page for the complete
deployment boundary.

A running node does not restart for a new deployment. Each node reads
`deploy/current.json` every 30 seconds (`CELLD_DEPLOY_POLL_S`) and adopts
a new deployment in place, and `POST /reload` on the internal listener
makes a node adopt the pointer now. A node builds the new deployment
beside the one it serves, and then it switches new requests to the new
deployment in one step. A request that started on the previous deployment
finishes on it. A deployment that does not build leaves the current
deployment serving, and the node reports the failure in its log and in
the `/reload` response. `POST /reload` also rebuilds an unchanged
deployment, so an edit to `CELLD_VARS_FILE` takes effect without a
restart.

A Durable Object that is not resident runs the new deployment at its
next activation. A resident Durable Object moves to the new deployment
at a safe point: no request runs in it, no alarm handler runs in it, no
output waits for durability, and no regular WebSocket is open. A request
that arrives while the object moves waits for the new code. The move
keeps the object's storage, its epoch, and its hibernatable WebSockets,
and it does not read or write the bucket. An object that reaches no safe
point in `CELLD_DEPLOY_MAX_AGE_S` seconds (default 60) is forced: celld
cancels its running work and closes its regular WebSockets with code
1012, which is what a Cloudflare deployment does to every object. A
value of 0 forces every resident object at the adoption. In this window,
a request on one deployment can call a Durable Object on the other, so
two adjacent versions must accept each other's calls. The `/state`
response reports the deployment a node serves, the deployments it still
drains, the objects that are moving, and the deployment each resident
object runs.

## Develop an application locally

Run `celld dev` in a Wrangler project:

```sh
celld dev
```

The command opens a local object store, deploys the application, and starts
one celld node. It does not require Docker or a cloud bucket. The Worker
listener uses `http://127.0.0.1:9876` by default. Use `--port` to select a
different port:

```sh
celld dev --port 3000
```

Use `--host` to select the Worker listener interface:

```sh
celld dev --host 0.0.0.0
```

A non-loopback IP exposes the Worker listener to the network. The internal
operator listener stays on loopback, so another machine cannot use its
operator API.

The default display uses color to identify each status and the application
URL. It hides the node warning and information logs, so the errors and the
listener remain easy to find. Use `--logs` to show these logs:

```sh
celld dev --logs
```

Set `NO_COLOR` to disable color. Set `FORCE_COLOR` to enable color when
the output is not a terminal. `NO_COLOR` always takes priority when both
variables are set.

You can also give the command a project directory or a Wrangler
configuration file:

```sh
celld dev ./examples/counter
```

The command stores the local objects and the celld work files in `.celld/dev`
below the project directory. Add `.celld/` to the application's `.gitignore`
file. A normal shutdown keeps this directory, so the next invocation uses the
same durable application state. Delete `.celld/dev` while `celld dev` is
stopped to reset that state.

The command does not expose the local object store through a fleet flag. A
regular node or an operator subcommand must use a supported cloud bucket.

The command watches the project directory. A source or configuration
change builds a new deployment and restarts the local node. The current
application continues to run during the build, and a failed build does
not replace it. The restart retains the durable application state.

The watcher ignores `.celld`, `.git`, `node_modules`, and `target`
directories at each depth. It does not watch a source file outside the
project directory. Worker projects need `esbuild` on `PATH`, and
asset-only projects do not need it.

## Operate D1 and KV

`celld d1` runs SQL and migrations against a deployed D1 database. The
command uses the fleet bucket to find a node, and the node routes the
operation to the database cell.

```sh
celld d1 migrations apply ledger --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET"
```

`celld kv` reads and writes a deployed KV namespace. The bulk commands use
the Wrangler file format, so `wrangler kv bulk get` can export data for
`celld kv bulk put`.

```sh
celld kv bulk put sessions wrangler-export.json --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET"
```

`celld kv list` prints at most 1000 keys, because a namespace can hold
many more keys than an operator wants to read. The command reports on
stderr that more keys exist, and it gives the `--after KEY` that continues
the listing. Pass `--all` to read every key, or `--json` for one JSON
object per key.

Every celld command writes its data to stdout and its messages to stderr,
so a redirect or a pipe carries only data:

```sh
celld kv list sessions --all --json --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" > keys.ndjson
```

`celld --help`, `celld --version`, and the listener announcements use the same
stdout sink. The sink treats a closed pipe as a successful stop, and it reports
all other write and flush errors.

## Start a node

For local development, the default listener is sufficient:

```sh
celld \
  --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" \
  --endpoint "$S3_ENDPOINT" \
  --region "$AWS_REGION"
```

For a fleet node, bind the public and internal listeners separately. The
ingress can reach the public listener, and the other nodes can reach the
internal listener:

```sh
celld \
  --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" \
  --endpoint "$S3_ENDPOINT" \
  --region "$AWS_REGION" \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --internal-listen 10.0.0.12:8081 \
  --advertise node-a.internal:8081
```

An explicit advertised address requires an explicit internal-listener
address: set both command-line options, or their equivalent environment
variables. celld also rejects an explicit non-loopback public listener
without an explicit internal listener, because that shape identifies an
obsolete one-listener configuration.

celld cannot verify that an advertised hostname or a translated port
reaches the internal listener. You must route the advertised address to
the internal listener, and you must not route it to the public Worker
listener.

## Add nodes

Start each node with the same bucket settings. Give each internal listener
a different address that the other nodes can reach, and set `--advertise`
to that address. The nodes find each other through the leases in the
bucket; there is no join command and no fixed membership list.

The bucket supplies discovery and authority, not network reachability.
Cell fetch and RPC traffic has a protocol version but has no content
signature, so the private network and its code are the security boundary.
Peer-control and reserved-cell operator requests use the fleet HMAC, but celld does not
terminate TLS. Put the advertised addresses on a private network that you
trust, or use an encrypted overlay such as WireGuard or Tailscale. The
internal listener also has an unauthenticated operator API, so it must not
reach the public internet. See the [security](security.md) page for the
complete boundary.

## Shut down and roll out a node

celld shuts a node down gracefully on SIGTERM or SIGINT, the signals that
`systemctl stop`, `docker stop`, and a Kubernetes pod delete send. The
`/.well-known/celld/health` path reports the node as unhealthy, so a load balancer
stops public routing to it. New public requests receive a 503 response,
and celld closes each connection so the client can retry on a healthy
node. The node finishes the public HTTP requests that it accepted before
shutdown, and it continues to accept versioned peer traffic for cells that
it has not handed off.

You must set a longer orchestrator stop grace, such as systemd
`TimeoutStopSec` or Kubernetes `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`. The grace
must cover the drain-token wait, the expected complete handoff, and one
no-progress interval (the settings below). Otherwise, the orchestrator
can send SIGKILL before celld completes the handoff.

The handoff works in batches. The node reserves a batch of cells and
stops new local routes to them: an accepted request stays local until it
finishes, and a new request waits for the successor route. The node
proves the batch durable and tries to publish one full snapshot of each
closed database. The snapshot is an L9 object, so the successor does not
replay the complete transaction history. The remote L0 chain remains an
additive fallback. If the snapshot retry window expires, the node releases
the cell with this proven L0 chain. The node then releases each ownership
record and asks a
compatible peer to acquire it. The peer acknowledges after the ownership
update and keeps the cell dormant, so the handoff does not restore an
unused runtime; a later request starts the cell under the peer activation
limit. The donor starts the next batch after each acknowledgement.

Four settings pace this work. `CELLD_RELEASES` sets the maximum number
of complete handoffs in progress (default 8), covering activity
cancellation, the durability proof, the final snapshot, the ownership
release, and the successor update; `CELLD_ACTIVATIONS` limits the
demand-driven restore and startup work. `CELLD_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_MS` sets
the maximum interval without a completed handoff (default 25000). Each
successor acknowledgement starts the interval again, so a large handoff
can continue while it makes progress. `CELLD_SHUTDOWN_TOTAL_MS` sets a 40000 ms
default bound for the complete process stop. An orchestrator stop grace must
be longer than this bound, so celld can finish its local durability shutdown.
A same-node preserve operation uses the shorter drain value as its semantic
limit because it has no successor acknowledgements.

Simultaneous stop signals do not flood the surviving nodes. A draining
node claims a fleet drain token in the bucket before it releases cells,
so concurrent donors hand off one node at a time. A donor that cannot
claim the token within `CELLD_DRAIN_TOKEN_WAIT_MS` milliseconds (default
30000; `0` disables the token) proceeds without it, because the
orchestrator grace is finite. The token is advisory: a dead holder's
claim expires, and a handoff without the token is still safe.

A fresh process also holds its first healthy response until the fleet is
settled. The process requires its live node lease, no active donor, and memory
below every pressure low watermark on each live node. It also requires a total
restore backlog no larger than one `CELLD_ACTIVATIONS` budget. The incumbent
ownership counts must remain within one equal successor share above the fleet
mean. A joining process can satisfy this condition when it advertises paced
handoff support and owns fewer cells than the busiest incumbent. The process
publishes this successor capacity before readiness, so an idle rollout can
repair the ownership distribution during the next donor handoff.

An older peer does not publish the low-watermark result, so the gate uses that
peer's pressure latch during a mixed-version update. An unreadable fleet or an
unsettled condition holds readiness for up to `CELLD_READY_FLEET_GATE_MS`
milliseconds (default 120000; `0` disables the gate). The process then reports
healthy with a `ready_gate_expired` event. After the first healthy response,
fleet state does not remove readiness again.

A deadline-cut handoff can leave a node-log recovery for the replacement.
One process reads and uploads that dead session, and the other processes wait
for its result. A waiting process can replace an unresponsive recovery after
30 seconds, so a failed recovery cannot block the fleet permanently. A
recovery store error keeps the session unsealed, so a later recovery must read
every retained bundle before the replacement can restore the acknowledged
state.

The internal listener continues to accept `/state` requests during the
drain, and the response reports the handoff and restore counters. The
public health response identifies the active drain with a 503 status.

To roll out a new version, use the rolling update of your orchestrator:
stop each node with SIGTERM, wait for its replacement to report healthy,
then move to the next node. celld paces the cell handoffs inside each node
shutdown, and the first-readiness gate paces the update against fleet
recovery, so a deployer does not need a separate fleet-level handoff gate.

Some upgrades are exceptions:

- The upgrade from v0.1.0 to v0.2.0 must not be a rolling update. Stop
  every v0.1.0 node, then start the v0.2.0 nodes. Two changes require
  this: v0.2.0 nodes advertise the internal listener, so ownership
  records that v0.1.0 nodes wrote name an address that v0.1.0 peers can
  not follow to a v0.2.0 node; and v0.2.0 compacts replicated data into
  block objects that a v0.1.0 reader can not restore. A fleet must not
  mix the two versions.
- The upgrade from v0.2.1 to v0.3.0 can use a rolling update. v0.3.0
  changes the default durability from `bucket` to `fleet`: a single node
  keeps the v0.2.1 behavior, and a fleet of two or more nodes activates
  fleet replication automatically. Stage the v0.3.0 binary on every node,
  and restart one node at a time. A mixed fleet stays safe, but a v0.3.0
  node cannot replicate to a v0.2.x peer, so it acknowledges writes
  through the bucket and retries until the peer runs v0.3.0. Do not start
  a v0.2.x binary after that node runs v0.3.0 unless the shutdown log
  contains `node-log close: sealed epoch`. A graceful stop attempts this
  seal, but a stop under load can leave the record open, and a v0.2.x
  binary cannot read writes that wait in the replicated log or bundle
  objects — this downgrade can lose acknowledged writes.
- The upgrade from v0.3.0 to v0.4.0 must not use a rolling update. Stop
  every v0.3.0 node, and then start the v0.4.0 nodes. v0.4.0 moves every
  proxied cell call — the fetch, the RPC, and the WebSocket — onto one
  tunneled connection that carries plain HTTP, and the peer protocol
  refuses a different version, so the two versions cannot proxy calls to
  each other. v0.4.0 also stores each new large KV value under its ownership
  epoch and writes an epoch-qualified row reference. A v0.3.0 node cannot
  read that reference, so a mixed fleet can make a committed KV value
  unavailable. The tunnel establishment carries the version, so a later
  protocol change can negotiate instead of refuse.

The internal listener also provides an alpha operator API. `/state`
reports the node state, `POST /reload` adopts the deployment pointer now,
and `POST /shutdown` starts the same graceful
handoff. The `POST /shutdown?handoff=preserve` request prepares a clean
same-node reload and keeps the ownership records. A release can change
this API, so keep the operator tooling and the celld release together.

## Diagnose a fleet

`celld diagnose` reads the node leases in the bucket and sends a probe to
each live peer. It does not take a lease, and it does not change
ownership.

```sh
celld diagnose \
  --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" \
  --endpoint "$S3_ENDPOINT" \
  --region "$AWS_REGION"
```

To probe only some nodes, use `--peer NODE_ID` one or more times. The
report identifies expired records, unsafe or incorrect advertised
addresses, peers that it cannot reach, authentication failures, and
protocol versions that do not agree.

Each node line also shows `restoring`: the count of cold routes that hold
an activation permit or wait for one (a capacity waiter already holds a
permit, so each cold route counts once). During a rolling update, wait
for every node to report `restoring=0` before you restart the next node,
so one restart's cold work finishes before the next restart removes more
warm capacity.

## List Durable Objects

List the Durable Object instances in the bucket:

```sh
celld cell list \
  --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" \
  --endpoint "$S3_ENDPOINT" \
  --region "$AWS_REGION"
```

Each line is a `Class:ID` cell scope. The ID is the Durable Object ID: a
64-character hash unless the application supplies its own name. Give a
class name to list only that class, and pass `--json` for one JSON object
per line. An instance appears after the first event reaches it, because
its owner then writes an ownership record to the bucket; an ID that an
application only derives does not appear.

The listing also shows celld's own cells. A D1 database, a KV namespace,
and a Workflow are each a cell in a reserved class, and their names start
with `__`. They hold real data in the bucket, therefore the command shows
them. The `--json` output marks each row with `"reserved": true` or
`false`, so a script can select one kind:

```sh
celld cell list --all --json --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" |
  jq -r 'select(.reserved | not) | .scope'
```

A storage request returns at most 1000 instances, so the command stops at
1000 instances and writes this line to stderr:

```
1000 cells shown; more exist. Continue with --after Room:d99d9174b25e46310694dd931b47fbde70a7460bb7b210b546060651ea2ff6e0
```

Pass that `--after SCOPE` to read the next 1000 instances, or use
`--limit N` for a different bound:

```sh
celld cell list --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" \
  --after Room:d99d9174b25e46310694dd931b47fbde70a7460bb7b210b546060651ea2ff6e0
```

Pass `--all` to read the whole listing in one command. This makes one
request for each 1000 instances, so it can take minutes on a large fleet;
the command reports its progress and its request count on stderr.

The order is the storage order, and `--after` continues from the last
instance printed, so a sequence of `--after` commands lists each instance
one time. An instance that an application creates during the sequence can
appear or not appear, because the listing is not a snapshot.

The command writes the instances to stdout and every message to stderr,
so a script reads only instance data:

```sh
celld cell list --all --json --bucket "$CELLD_BUCKET" > cells.ndjson
```

## Hot-cell overload

celld admits a maximum of 64 concurrent fetch events for one Durable Object
or Queue broker. Set `CELLD_MAX_CELL_REQUESTS` to use a different positive
limit.

celld returns HTTP status `503` when the target reaches this limit, and it
does not start the excess event. The response contains `Retry-After: 1` and
`X-Celld-Overload: cell`, so the application can retry or reject the work.
A local or remote Queue owner uses the same status and headers when it refuses
producer admission. The Queue response body is
`{"error":"cell admission refused"}`. A fixed-rate client must count the
response as rejected work, so an immediate retry does not increase the
configured offered rate.

The runtime writes a `cell_overload_refused` log event when a target becomes
saturated. The event contains the cell scope, the node, the region, the
in-flight count, and the limit. Count these overload responses separately
from the transport errors and the application failures.

## Environment variables

For the full list, run `celld -h`. This table shows the primary settings:

| variable | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CELLD_BUCKET` | The fleet bucket, and an optional key prefix. The same as `--bucket` |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | The S3-compatible endpoint. The same as `--endpoint` |
| `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | The storage region |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | Explicit AWS credentials. The standard AWS credential chain is also available |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Google credentials for a `gs://` bucket. Application Default Credentials are also available |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | The storage account for an `az://` bucket. The bucket NAME is the container |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | The storage account key. Do not combine it with an identity selector |
| `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` | The standard AKS workload identity environment for an `az://` bucket. The authority must be the public Azure host |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_USE_EMULATOR` | Set to `true` to develop against Azurite. celld does not qualify Azurite for a production fleet |
| `CELLD_ADDR` | The public Worker listener. The same as `--listen` |
| `CELLD_INTERNAL_ADDR` | The peer and operator listener. The same as `--internal-listen` |
| `CELLD_ADVERTISE` | The internal address that peers can reach. The same as `--advertise` |
| `CELLD_UNSAFE_PUBLIC_ADVERTISE` | Set to `1` to permit a literal public IP in `CELLD_ADVERTISE`. This setting does not resolve a DNS name or restrict the internal listener |
| `CELLD_NODE` | An explicit node-session ID |
| `CELLD_WATCH` | The local work directory for SQLite and replication |
| `CELLD_ESBUILD` | The path of the esbuild executable |
| `CELLD_ACTIVATIONS` | The limit for concurrent cold-cell activations (default: the available CPU count or 128, whichever is smaller) |
| `CELLD_DEPLOY_POLL_S` | The interval in seconds at which a node reads the deployment pointer and adopts a new deployment in place (default: 30) |
| `CELLD_DEPLOY_MAX_AGE_S` | How long a resident Durable Object can keep the previous deployment's code after an adoption before celld forces the move (default: 60; 0 forces at once) |
| `CELLD_OPERATION_DEADLINE_MS` | The deadline for a non-restore operation (default: 15000) |
| `CELLD_WORKER_LOADER` | Bind a Worker Loader (Code Mode) at this `env` name. A Worker can then start isolates at runtime. Off unless set (experimental) |
| `CELLD_MAX_LOADED_WORKERS` | The limit for concurrent loaded workers (default: 256) |
| `CELLD_MAX_CELL_REQUESTS` | The concurrent fetch limit for one Durable Object or Queue broker (default: 64) |
| `CELLD_MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` | The body limit for a public Worker request or a direct Durable Object request (default: 1 GiB) |
| `CELLD_MAX_RESIDENT_CELLS` | The hard limit for resident cells, enforced at admission |
| `CELLD_MAX_CELLS_PER_ISOLATE` | Cell packing limit per V8 isolate (1–32; default: 32). Lower values can increase CPU parallelism at the cost of additional heaps. Packing, retirement, and node memory admission rules remain unchanged. This is a process-start setting; it does not migrate existing cells |
| `CELLD_MAX_RSS_MB` | The memory threshold for pressure shedding, applied to the greater of the allocator-adjusted RSS and the allocator-adjusted active cgroup working set (default: 80% of the available memory; 0 disables the threshold and the absolute cap) |
| `CELLD_OUTPUT_GATE` | The default is `1`, so celld proves each write durable before it acknowledges the write. Set `0` to remove the replication wait and accept possible loss of an acknowledged write |
| `CELLD_DURABILITY` | How celld proves a write durable before it answers. The default is `fleet`: the node serving the cell sends the write to one or two other nodes and answers once they hold it on disk, or once the bucket upload finishes, whichever comes first. This needs two or more nodes; a single node has nobody to send to, so every write waits for the bucket. Set `bucket` to always wait for the bucket |
| `CELLD_LOG_CAPTURE_WORKERS` | The limit for concurrent log-capture workers (default: 8) |
| `CELLD_LOG_PIPELINE` | The limit for fleet log rounds that can be in flight (default: 4) |
| `CELLD_LOG_HEDGE_MS` | The wait before a leader sends a second copy of a slow log append to a follower. The default is adaptive: celld derives the wait from the slowest recent append in the ensemble (4 times that append, at least 250 ms, and always below the eviction backstop), so a loaded fleet does not send copies for honest slow appends. Set a value to use a fixed wait in milliseconds, and set `0` to disable the second copy. An append is idempotent per sequence, so the copy is safe, and the leader uses the answer that arrives first and confirms |
| `CELLD_LTX_TRUNCATE_PAGES` | The WAL size, in pages, at which celld truncates an ordinary cell's WAL file at the next checkpoint (default: 128, a 512 KiB cap). A passive checkpoint does not shrink the WAL file, so each capture reads the stale region after a restart. The truncate keeps the read small. Queue cells use passive checkpoints because a truncate boundary emits a full database image. Set `0` to disable the truncate for all cells |
| `CELLD_LTX_COMPACTION` | The default is `1`: celld creates additive L1 objects, and a takeover reads tens of objects instead of thousands. Set `0` on every node of a mixed fleet until all nodes can read v0.5.2 block objects, because an old reader cannot take over a cell after its first L1 publication |
| `CELLD_LTX_COMPACTION_MIN_TXIDS` | The durable TXID distance that queues a background L1 attempt (default: 256) |
| `CELLD_LTX_COMPACTIONS` | The node-wide limit for concurrent background L1 attempts (default: 2). `CELLD_RELEASES` bounds final handoff snapshots |
| `CELLD_LTX_DURABILITY_TIMEOUT_SECS` | The deadline for a durability proof and the final snapshot retry window, in seconds (default: 10). A slow or busy object store can need a longer deadline for a large write burst |
| `CELLD_VAR_*`, `CELLD_VARS_FILE` | Worker variable overrides |
| `RUST_LOG` | The runtime log filter |

The help output also shows the advanced tuning switches and their
defaults.

An unset variable selects its documented default. A Boolean variable
accepts only `0` or `1`. celld exits during startup when a supplied value
is invalid.
